Instructions will be provided for each section, and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a ‘TODO’ statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully! Note: Once you have completed all of the code implementations, you need to finalize your work by exporting the Jupyter Notebook as an HTML document. Before exporting the notebook to html, all of the code cells need to have been run so that reviewers can see the final implementation and output. You can then export the notebook by using the menu above and navigating to File -&gt; Download as -&gt; HTML (.html). Include the finished document along with this notebook as your submission. In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a ‘Question X’ header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with ‘Answer:’.

The rubric contains optional “Stand Out Suggestions” for enhancing the project beyond the minimum requirements. If you decide to pursue the “Stand Out Suggestions”, you should include the code in this Jupyter notebook. Why We’re Here In this notebook, you will make the first steps towards developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app. At the end of this project, your code will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog’s breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling. The image below displays potential sample output of your finished project (… but we expect that each student’s algorithm will behave differently!). In this real-world setting, you will need to piece together a series of models to perform different tasks; for instance, the algorithm that detects humans in an image will be different from the CNN that infers dog breed. There are many points of possible failure, and no perfect algorithm exists. Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience! The Road Ahead We break the notebook into separate steps. Feel free to use the links below to navigate the notebook. Step 0: Import Datasets Step 1: Detect Humans Step 2: Detect Dogs Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch) Step 4: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning) Step 5: Write your Algorithm Step 6: Test Your Algorithm Step 0: Import Datasets Make sure that you’ve downloaded the required human and dog datasets: Note: if you are using the Udacity workspace, you DO NOT need to re-download these - they can be found in the /data folder as noted in the cell below. Download the dog dataset. Unzip the folder and place it in this project’s home directory, at the location /dog_images. Download the human dataset. Unzip the folder and place it in the home directory, at location /lfw. Note: If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use 7zip to extract the folder. In the code cell below, we save the file paths for both the human (LFW) dataset and dog dataset in the numpy arrays human_files and dog_files. import numpy as np from glob import glob # load filenames for human and dog images human_files = np.array(glob(&quot;/data/lfw/*/*&quot;)) dog_files = np.array(glob(&quot;/data/dog_images/*/*/*&quot;)) # print number of images in each dataset print(&#39;There are %d total human images.&#39; % len(human_files)) print(&#39;There are %d total dog images.&#39; % len(dog_files)) There are 13233 total human images. There are 8351 total dog images. Step 1: Detect Humans In this section, we use OpenCV’s implementation of Haar feature-based cascade classifiers to detect human faces in images. OpenCV provides many pre-trained face detectors, stored as XML files on github. We have downloaded one of these detectors and stored it in the haarcascades directory. In the next code cell, we demonstrate how to use this detector to find human faces in a sample image. import cv2 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt %matplotlib inline # extract pre-trained face detector face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(&#39;haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml&#39;) # load color (BGR) image img = cv2.imread(human_files[0]) # convert BGR image to grayscale gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) # find faces in image faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray) # print number of faces detected in the image print(&#39;Number of faces detected:&#39;, len(faces)) # get bounding box for each detected face for (x,y,w,h) in faces: # add bounding box to color image cv2.rectangle(img,(x,y),(x+w,y+h),(255,0,0),2) # convert BGR image to RGB for plotting cv_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB) # display the image, along with bounding box plt.imshow(cv_rgb) plt.show() Number of faces detected: 1 Before using any of the face detectors, it is standard procedure to convert the images to grayscale. The detectMultiScale function executes the classifier stored in face_cascade and takes the grayscale image as a parameter. In the above code, faces is a numpy array of detected faces, where each row corresponds to a detected face. Each detected face is a 1D array with four entries that specifies the bounding box of the detected face. The first two entries in the array (extracted in the above code as x and y) specify the horizontal and vertical positions of the top left corner of the bounding box. The last two entries in the array (extracted here as w and h) specify the width and height of the box. Write a Human Face Detector We can use this procedure to write a function that returns True if a human face is detected in an image and False otherwise. This function, aptly named face_detector, takes a string-valued file path to an image as input and appears in the code block below. # returns &quot;True&quot; if face is detected in image stored at img_path def face_detector(img_path): img = cv2.imread(img_path) gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray) return len(faces) &gt; 0 (IMPLEMENTATION) Assess the Human Face Detector Question 1: Use the code cell below to test the performance of the face_detector function. What percentage of the first 100 images in human_files have a detected human face? What percentage of the first 100 images in dog_files have a detected human face? Ideally, we would like 100% of human images with a detected face and 0% of dog images with a detected face. You will see that our algorithm falls short of this goal, but still gives acceptable performance. We extract the file paths for the first 100 images from each of the datasets and store them in the numpy arrays human_files_short and dog_files_short. Answer: (You can print out your results and/or write your percentages in this cell) from tqdm import tqdm human_files_short = human_files[:100] dog_files_short = dog_files[:100] #-#-# Do NOT modify the code above this line. #-#-# ## TODO: Test the performance of the face_detector algorithm ## on the images in human_files_short and dog_files_short. n_range = range(100) countHuman = sum([face_detector(human_files_short[i]) for i in n_range]) countDog = sum([face_detector(dog_files_short[i]) for i in n_range]) print(&quot;Predicted Human Faces on Human dataset:&quot;, countHuman) print(&quot;Accuracy:&quot;, countHuman/100, &quot;\n&quot;) print(&quot;Predicted Human Faces on Dog dataset:&quot;, countDog) print(&quot;Accuracy:&quot;, 1 - countDog/100) Predicted Human Faces on Human dataset: 98 Accuracy: 0.98 Predicted Human Faces on Dog dataset: 17 Accuracy: 0.83 We suggest the face detector from OpenCV as a potential way to detect human images in your algorithm, but you are free to explore other approaches, especially approaches that make use of deep learning :). Please use the code cell below to design and test your own face detection algorithm.

Obtain Pre-trained VGG-16 Model The code cell below downloads the VGG-16 model, along with weights that have been trained on ImageNet, a very large, very popular dataset used for image classification and other vision tasks. ImageNet contains over 10 million URLs, each linking to an image containing an object from one of 1000 categories. import torch import torchvision.models as models # define VGG16 model VGG16 = models.vgg16(pretrained=True) # check if CUDA is available use_cuda = torch.cuda.is_available() # move model to GPU if CUDA is available if use_cuda: VGG16 = VGG16.cuda() Given an image, this pre-trained VGG-16 model returns a prediction (derived from the 1000 possible categories in ImageNet) for the object that is contained in the image. (IMPLEMENTATION) Making Predictions with a Pre-trained Model In the next code cell, you will write a function that accepts a path to an image (such as &#39;dogImages/train/001.Affenpinscher/Affenpinscher_00001.jpg&#39;) as input and returns the index corresponding to the ImageNet class that is predicted by the pre-trained VGG-16 model. The output should always be an integer between 0 and 999, inclusive. Before writing the function, make sure that you take the time to learn how to appropriately pre-process tensors for pre-trained models in the PyTorch documentation. from PIL import Image, ImageFile import torchvision.transforms as transforms from torchvision import datasets, models, transforms def VGG16_predict(img_path): &#39;&#39;&#39; Use pre-trained VGG-16 model to obtain index corresponding to predicted ImageNet class for image at specified path Args: img_path: path to an image Returns: Index corresponding to VGG-16 model&#39;s prediction &#39;&#39;&#39; ## TODO: Complete the function. ## Load and pre-process an image from the given img_path ## Return the *index* of the predicted class for that image ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True image = Image.open(img_path).convert(&#39;RGB&#39;) normalize = transforms.Normalize( mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225] ) preprocess = transforms.Compose([ transforms.Resize(256), transforms.CenterCrop(224), transforms.ToTensor(), normalize] ) img_tensor = preprocess(image) img_tensor.unsqueeze_(0) # Load the pretrained model from pytorch vgg16 = models.vgg16(pretrained=True) # get sample outputs output = vgg16(img_tensor) _, pred = torch.max(output, 1) return pred.numpy()[0] # predicted class index (IMPLEMENTATION) Write a Dog Detector While looking at the dictionary, you will notice that the categories corresponding to dogs appear in an uninterrupted sequence and correspond to dictionary keys 151-268, inclusive, to include all categories from &#39;Chihuahua&#39; to &#39;Mexican hairless&#39;. Thus, in order to check to see if an image is predicted to contain a dog by the pre-trained VGG-16 model, we need only check if the pre-trained model predicts an index between 151 and 268 (inclusive). Use these ideas to complete the dog_detector function below, which returns True if a dog is detected in an image (and False if not). ### returns &quot;True&quot; if a dog is detected in the image stored at img_path def dog_detector(img_path): ## TODO: Complete the function. output = VGG16_predict(img_path) return output &gt;= 151 and output &lt; 269 # true/false (IMPLEMENTATION) Assess the Dog Detector Question 2: Use the code cell below to test the performance of your dog_detector function. What percentage of the images in human_files_short have a detected dog? What percentage of the images in dog_files_short have a detected dog? Answer: ### TODO: Test the performance of the dog_detector function ### on the images in human_files_short and dog_files_short. countHuman = sum([dog_detector(human_files_short[i]) for i in n_range]) countDog = sum([dog_detector(dog_files_short[i]) for i in n_range]) print(&quot;Predicted Human Faces on Human dataset:&quot;, countHuman) print(&quot;Accuracy:&quot;, 1- countHuman/100, &quot;\n&quot;) print(&quot;Predicted Human Faces on Dog dataset:&quot;, countDog) print(&quot;Accuracy:&quot;, countDog/100) Predicted Human Faces on Human dataset: 2 Accuracy: 0.98 Predicted Human Faces on Dog dataset: 100 Accuracy: 1.0 We suggest VGG-16 as a potential network to detect dog images in your algorithm, but you are free to explore other pre-trained networks (such as Inception-v3, ResNet-50, etc). Please use the code cell below to test other pre-trained PyTorch models. If you decide to pursue this optional task, report performance on human_files_short and dog_files_short. ### (Optional) ### TODO: Report the performance of another pre-trained network. ### Feel free to use as many code cells as needed. def res_predict(img_path): ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True image = Image.open(img_path).convert(&#39;RGB&#39;) normalize = transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]) preprocess = transforms.Compose([ transforms.Resize(256), transforms.CenterCrop(224), transforms.ToTensor(), normalize]) img_tensor = preprocess(image) img_tensor.unsqueeze_(0) # Load the pretrained model from pytorch resnet50 = models.resnet50(pretrained=True) # get sample outputs output = resnet50(img_tensor) _, pred = torch.max(output, 1) return pred.numpy()[0] # predicted class index ### returns &quot;True&quot; if a dog is detected in the image stored at img_path def resnetdog_detector(img_path): ## TODO: Complete the function. output = VGG16_predict(img_path) return output &gt;= 151 and output &lt; 269 # true/false ### TODO: Test the performance of the dog_detector function ### on the images in human_files_short and dog_files_short. countHuman = sum([resnetdog_detector(human_files_short[i]) for i in n_range]) countDog = sum([resnetdog_detector(dog_files_short[i]) for i in n_range]) print(&quot;Predicted Human Faces on Human dataset:&quot;, countHuman) print(&quot;Accuracy:&quot;, 1- countHuman/100, &quot;\n&quot;) print(&quot;Predicted Human Faces on Dog dataset:&quot;, countDog) print(&quot;Accuracy:&quot;, countDog/100) Predicted Human Faces on Human dataset: 1 Accuracy: 0.99 Predicted Human Faces on Dog dataset: 100 Accuracy: 1.0 Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch) Now that we have functions for detecting humans and dogs in images, we need a way to predict breed from images. In this step, you will create a CNN that classifies dog breeds. You must create your CNN from scratch (so, you can’t use transfer learning yet!), and you must attain a test accuracy of at least 10%. In Step 4 of this notebook, you will have the opportunity to use transfer learning to create a CNN that attains greatly improved accuracy. We mention that the task of assigning breed to dogs from images is considered exceptionally challenging. To see why, consider that even a human would have trouble distinguishing between a Brittany and a Welsh Springer Spaniel. Brittany Welsh Springer Spaniel It is not difficult to find other dog breed pairs with minimal inter-class variation (for instance, Curly-Coated Retrievers and American Water Spaniels). Curly-Coated Retriever American Water Spaniel Likewise, recall that labradors come in yellow, chocolate, and black. Your vision-based algorithm will have to conquer this high intra-class variation to determine how to classify all of these different shades as the same breed. Yellow Labrador Chocolate Labrador Black Labrador We also mention that random chance presents an exceptionally low bar: setting aside the fact that the classes are slightly imabalanced, a random guess will provide a correct answer roughly 1 in 133 times, which corresponds to an accuracy of less than 1%. Remember that the practice is far ahead of the theory in deep learning. Experiment with many different architectures, and trust your intuition. And, of course, have fun! (IMPLEMENTATION) Specify Data Loaders for the Dog Dataset Use the code cell below to write three separate data loaders for the training, validation, and test datasets of dog images (located at dog_images/train, dog_images/valid, and dog_images/test, respectively). You may find this documentation on custom datasets to be a useful resource. If you are interested in augmenting your training and/or validation data, check out the wide variety of transforms! from PIL import Image, ImageFile import os from torchvision import datasets from torchvision.datasets import ImageFolder from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader import torchvision.transforms as transforms import torch import PIL ### TODO: Write data loaders for training, validation, and test sets ## Specify appropriate transforms, and batch_sizes ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True # number of subprocesses and samples per batch num_workers = 0 batch_size = 20 # convert data to a normalized torch.FloatTensor transform = { &#39;train&#39;: transforms.Compose([ transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224), transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(), transforms.RandomRotation(10), transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]) ]), &#39;valid&#39;: transforms.Compose([ transforms.Resize(256), transforms.CenterCrop(224), transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]) ]), &#39;test&#39;: transforms.Compose([ transforms.Resize(256), transforms.CenterCrop(224), transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]) ]), } data_dir = &#39;/data/dog_images&#39; train_dir = data_dir + &#39;/train&#39; valid_dir = data_dir + &#39;/valid&#39; test_dir = data_dir + &#39;/test&#39; # Reading Dataset image_datasets = { &#39;train&#39; : ImageFolder(root=train_dir,transform=transform[&#39;train&#39;]), &#39;valid&#39; : ImageFolder(root=valid_dir,transform=transform[&#39;valid&#39;]), &#39;test&#39; : ImageFolder(root=test_dir,transform=transform[&#39;test&#39;]) } loaders_scratch = { &#39;train&#39; : DataLoader(image_datasets[&#39;train&#39;], shuffle = True, batch_size = batch_size), &#39;valid&#39; : DataLoader(image_datasets[&#39;valid&#39;], shuffle = True, batch_size = batch_size), &#39;test&#39; : DataLoader(image_datasets[&#39;test&#39;], shuffle = True, batch_size = batch_size) } Question 3: Describe your chosen procedure for preprocessing the data. How does your code resize the images (by cropping, stretching, etc)? What size did you pick for the input tensor, and why? Did you decide to augment the dataset? If so, how (through translations, flips, rotations, etc)? If not, why not? Answer: The code resizes images by cropping, while on the trainning data it was done randomly using transforms.RandomResizedCrop, in the validation and testing dataset it was done with transforms.CenterCrop and also transforms.Resize. The input tensor receives inputs of size (3 x 224 x 224), and this size was chosen after constant trial and error. In addition, the following text was extrected from the Pytorch Documentation: All pre-trained models expect input images normalized in the same way, i.e. mini-batches of 3-channel RGB images of shape (3 x H x W), where H and W are expected to be at least 224. The images have to be loaded in to a range of [0, 1] and then normalized using mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]. Data augmentation was used to avoid overfitting, that means to avoid the a very good performance on the trainning set but a bed performane on the validation and testing datasets (bed generalization). The methods used were: Flipping the images horizontally Random Cropping: Extract randomly a 224 × 224 pixels section from 256 × 256 pixels RandomRotation: Randomly rotate the image by 10 degrees.

Answer: The CNN has five convolutional layers. The first layer has 16 filters, doubling every layer until 256 filters on the last layer. stride = 1 and padding = 1 in every layer. There are Relu activations after each layers. Each followed by a max pooling layer of size 2.

Describe why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem. Answer: In this project we will use the End of ConvNet approach for transfer learning. Since we have a small dataset to train our model, a model built from scratch would most likely perform poorly. The data used to train the VGG.16 is quite similar to our trainning data, added to the fact that our trainning data set is small makes it suited to this approach. The steps are the following: Add one fully connected layer replacing the last layer of the pre-trained model. This new fully connected layer will have 133 categories as output, differently from the previous deleted layer. Randomize the weights of the new fully connected layer Freeze all the weights from the pre-trained network Train the network to update the weights of the new fully connected layer After retrainning the model, the accuracy is ~ 85%, a satisfatory performance according to the asked threshold.

You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with ‘(IMPLEMENTATION)’ in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section, and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a ‘TODO’ statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully! Note: Once you have completed all of the code implementations, you need to finalize your work by exporting the Jupyter Notebook as an HTML document. Before exporting the notebook to html, all of the code cells need to have been run so that reviewers can see the final implementation and output. You can then export the notebook by using the menu above and navigating to File -&gt; Download as -&gt; HTML (.html). Include the finished document along with this notebook as your submission. In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a ‘Question X’ header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with ‘Answer:’. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide. Note: Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the Shift + Enter keyboard shortcut. Markdown cells can be edited by double-clicking the cell to enter edit mode. The rubric contains optional “Stand Out Suggestions” for enhancing the project beyond the minimum requirements. If you decide to pursue the “Stand Out Suggestions”, you should include the code in this Jupyter notebook. Why We’re Here In this notebook, you will make the first steps towards developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app. At the end of this project, your code will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog’s breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling. The image below displays potential sample output of your finished project (… but we expect that each student’s algorithm will behave differently!). In this real-world setting, you will need to piece together a series of models to perform different tasks; for instance, the algorithm that detects humans in an image will be different from the CNN that infers dog breed. There are many points of possible failure, and no perfect algorithm exists. Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience! The Road Ahead We break the notebook into separate steps. Feel free to use the links below to navigate the notebook. Step 0: Import Datasets Step 1: Detect Humans Step 2: Detect Dogs Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch) Step 4: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning) Step 5: Write your Algorithm Step 6: Test Your Algorithm Step 0: Import Datasets Make sure that you’ve downloaded the required human and dog datasets: Note: if you are using the Udacity workspace, you DO NOT need to re-download these - they can be found in the /data folder as noted in the cell below. Download the dog dataset. Unzip the folder and place it in this project’s home directory, at the location /dog_images. Download the human dataset. Unzip the folder and place it in the home directory, at location /lfw. Note: If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use 7zip to extract the folder. In the code cell below, we save the file paths for both the human (LFW) dataset and dog dataset in the numpy arrays human_files and dog_files. import numpy as np from glob import glob # load filenames for human and dog images human_files = np.array(glob(&quot;/data/lfw/*/*&quot;)) dog_files = np.array(glob(&quot;/data/dog_images/*/*/*&quot;)) # print number of images in each dataset print(&#39;There are %d total human images.&#39; % len(human_files)) print(&#39;There are %d total dog images.&#39; % len(dog_files)) There are 13233 total human images. There are 8351 total dog images. Step 1: Detect Humans In this section, we use OpenCV’s implementation of Haar feature-based cascade classifiers to detect human faces in images. OpenCV provides many pre-trained face detectors, stored as XML files on github. We have downloaded one of these detectors and stored it in the haarcascades directory. In the next code cell, we demonstrate how to use this detector to find human faces in a sample image. import cv2 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt %matplotlib inline # extract pre-trained face detector face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(&#39;haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml&#39;) # load color (BGR) image img = cv2.imread(human_files[0]) # convert BGR image to grayscale gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) # find faces in image faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray) # print number of faces detected in the image print(&#39;Number of faces detected:&#39;, len(faces)) # get bounding box for each detected face for (x,y,w,h) in faces: # add bounding box to color image cv2.rectangle(img,(x,y),(x+w,y+h),(255,0,0),2) # convert BGR image to RGB for plotting cv_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB) # display the image, along with bounding box plt.imshow(cv_rgb) plt.show() Number of faces detected: 1 Before using any of the face detectors, it is standard procedure to convert the images to grayscale. The detectMultiScale function executes the classifier stored in face_cascade and takes the grayscale image as a parameter. In the above code, faces is a numpy array of detected faces, where each row corresponds to a detected face. Each detected face is a 1D array with four entries that specifies the bounding box of the detected face. The first two entries in the array (extracted in the above code as x and y) specify the horizontal and vertical positions of the top left corner of the bounding box. The last two entries in the array (extracted here as w and h) specify the width and height of the box. Write a Human Face Detector We can use this procedure to write a function that returns True if a human face is detected in an image and False otherwise. This function, aptly named face_detector, takes a string-valued file path to an image as input and appears in the code block below. # returns &quot;True&quot; if face is detected in image stored at img_path def face_detector(img_path): img = cv2.imread(img_path) gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray) return len(faces) &gt; 0 (IMPLEMENTATION) Assess the Human Face Detector Question 1: Use the code cell below to test the performance of the face_detector function. What percentage of the first 100 images in human_files have a detected human face? What percentage of the first 100 images in dog_files have a detected human face? Ideally, we would like 100% of human images with a detected face and 0% of dog images with a detected face. You will see that our algorithm falls short of this goal, but still gives acceptable performance. We extract the file paths for the first 100 images from each of the datasets and store them in the numpy arrays human_files_short and dog_files_short. Answer: (You can print out your results and/or write your percentages in this cell) from tqdm import tqdm human_files_short = human_files[:100] dog_files_short = dog_files[:100] #-#-# Do NOT modify the code above this line. #-#-# ## TODO: Test the performance of the face_detector algorithm ## on the images in human_files_short and dog_files_short. n_range = range(100) countHuman = sum([face_detector(human_files_short[i]) for i in n_range]) countDog = sum([face_detector(dog_files_short[i]) for i in n_range]) print(&quot;Predicted Human Faces on Human dataset:&quot;, countHuman) print(&quot;Accuracy:&quot;, countHuman/100, &quot;\n&quot;) print(&quot;Predicted Human Faces on Dog dataset:&quot;, countDog) print(&quot;Accuracy:&quot;, 1 - countDog/100) Predicted Human Faces on Human dataset: 98 Accuracy: 0.98 Predicted Human Faces on Dog dataset: 17 Accuracy: 0.83 We suggest the face detector from OpenCV as a potential way to detect human images in your algorithm, but you are free to explore other approaches, especially approaches that make use of deep learning :). Please use the code cell below to design and test your own face detection algorithm.

Obtain Pre-trained VGG-16 Model The code cell below downloads the VGG-16 model, along with weights that have been trained on ImageNet, a very large, very popular dataset used for image classification and other vision tasks. ImageNet contains over 10 million URLs, each linking to an image containing an object from one of 1000 categories. import torch import torchvision.models as models # define VGG16 model VGG16 = models.vgg16(pretrained=True) # check if CUDA is available use_cuda = torch.cuda.is_available() # move model to GPU if CUDA is available if use_cuda: VGG16 = VGG16.cuda() Given an image, this pre-trained VGG-16 model returns a prediction (derived from the 1000 possible categories in ImageNet) for the object that is contained in the image. (IMPLEMENTATION) Making Predictions with a Pre-trained Model In the next code cell, you will write a function that accepts a path to an image (such as &#39;dogImages/train/001.Affenpinscher/Affenpinscher_00001.jpg&#39;) as input and returns the index corresponding to the ImageNet class that is predicted by the pre-trained VGG-16 model. The output should always be an integer between 0 and 999, inclusive. Before writing the function, make sure that you take the time to learn how to appropriately pre-process tensors for pre-trained models in the PyTorch documentation. from PIL import Image, ImageFile import torchvision.transforms as transforms from torchvision import datasets, models, transforms def VGG16_predict(img_path): &#39;&#39;&#39; Use pre-trained VGG-16 model to obtain index corresponding to predicted ImageNet class for image at specified path Args: img_path: path to an image Returns: Index corresponding to VGG-16 model&#39;s prediction &#39;&#39;&#39; ## TODO: Complete the function. ## Load and pre-process an image from the given img_path ## Return the *index* of the predicted class for that image ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True image = Image.open(img_path).convert(&#39;RGB&#39;) normalize = transforms.Normalize( mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225] ) preprocess = transforms.Compose([ transforms.Resize(256), transforms.CenterCrop(224), transforms.ToTensor(), normalize] ) img_tensor = preprocess(image) img_tensor.unsqueeze_(0) # Load the pretrained model from pytorch vgg16 = models.vgg16(pretrained=True) # get sample outputs output = vgg16(img_tensor) _, pred = torch.max(output, 1) return pred.numpy()[0] # predicted class index (IMPLEMENTATION) Write a Dog Detector While looking at the dictionary, you will notice that the categories corresponding to dogs appear in an uninterrupted sequence and correspond to dictionary keys 151-268, inclusive, to include all categories from &#39;Chihuahua&#39; to &#39;Mexican hairless&#39;. Thus, in order to check to see if an image is predicted to contain a dog by the pre-trained VGG-16 model, we need only check if the pre-trained model predicts an index between 151 and 268 (inclusive). Use these ideas to complete the dog_detector function below, which returns True if a dog is detected in an image (and False if not). ### returns &quot;True&quot; if a dog is detected in the image stored at img_path def dog_detector(img_path): ## TODO: Complete the function. output = VGG16_predict(img_path) return output &gt;= 151 and output &lt; 269 # true/false (IMPLEMENTATION) Assess the Dog Detector Question 2: Use the code cell below to test the performance of your dog_detector function. What percentage of the images in human_files_short have a detected dog? What percentage of the images in dog_files_short have a detected dog? Answer: ### TODO: Test the performance of the dog_detector function ### on the images in human_files_short and dog_files_short. countHuman = sum([dog_detector(human_files_short[i]) for i in n_range]) countDog = sum([dog_detector(dog_files_short[i]) for i in n_range]) print(&quot;Predicted Human Faces on Human dataset:&quot;, countHuman) print(&quot;Accuracy:&quot;, 1- countHuman/100, &quot;\n&quot;) print(&quot;Predicted Human Faces on Dog dataset:&quot;, countDog) print(&quot;Accuracy:&quot;, countDog/100) Predicted Human Faces on Human dataset: 2 Accuracy: 0.98 Predicted Human Faces on Dog dataset: 100 Accuracy: 1.0 We suggest VGG-16 as a potential network to detect dog images in your algorithm, but you are free to explore other pre-trained networks (such as Inception-v3, ResNet-50, etc). Please use the code cell below to test other pre-trained PyTorch models.

In this step, you will create a CNN that classifies dog breeds. You must create your CNN from scratch (so, you can’t use transfer learning yet!), and you must attain a test accuracy of at least 10%. In Step 4 of this notebook, you will have the opportunity to use transfer learning to create a CNN that attains greatly improved accuracy. We mention that the task of assigning breed to dogs from images is considered exceptionally challenging. To see why, consider that even a human would have trouble distinguishing between a Brittany and a Welsh Springer Spaniel. Brittany Welsh Springer Spaniel It is not difficult to find other dog breed pairs with minimal inter-class variation (for instance, Curly-Coated Retrievers and American Water Spaniels). Curly-Coated Retriever American Water Spaniel Likewise, recall that labradors come in yellow, chocolate, and black. Your vision-based algorithm will have to conquer this high intra-class variation to determine how to classify all of these different shades as the same breed. Yellow Labrador Chocolate Labrador Black Labrador We also mention that random chance presents an exceptionally low bar: setting aside the fact that the classes are slightly imabalanced, a random guess will provide a correct answer roughly 1 in 133 times, which corresponds to an accuracy of less than 1%. Remember that the practice is far ahead of the theory in deep learning. Experiment with many different architectures, and trust your intuition. And, of course, have fun! (IMPLEMENTATION) Specify Data Loaders for the Dog Dataset Use the code cell below to write three separate data loaders for the training, validation, and test datasets of dog images (located at dog_images/train, dog_images/valid, and dog_images/test, respectively). You may find this documentation on custom datasets to be a useful resource. If you are interested in augmenting your training and/or validation data, check out the wide variety of transforms! from PIL import Image, ImageFile import os from torchvision import datasets from torchvision.datasets import ImageFolder from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader import torchvision.transforms as transforms import torch import PIL ### TODO: Write data loaders for training, validation, and test sets ## Specify appropriate transforms, and batch_sizes ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True # number of subprocesses and samples per batch num_workers = 0 batch_size = 20 # convert data to a normalized torch.FloatTensor transform = { &#39;train&#39;: transforms.Compose([ transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224), transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(), transforms.RandomRotation(10), transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]) ]), &#39;valid&#39;: transforms.Compose([ transforms.Resize(256), transforms.CenterCrop(224), transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]) ]), &#39;test&#39;: transforms.Compose([ transforms.Resize(256), transforms.CenterCrop(224), transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]) ]), } data_dir = &#39;/data/dog_images&#39; train_dir = data_dir + &#39;/train&#39; valid_dir = data_dir + &#39;/valid&#39; test_dir = data_dir + &#39;/test&#39; # Reading Dataset image_datasets = { &#39;train&#39; : ImageFolder(root=train_dir,transform=transform[&#39;train&#39;]), &#39;valid&#39; : ImageFolder(root=valid_dir,transform=transform[&#39;valid&#39;]), &#39;test&#39; : ImageFolder(root=test_dir,transform=transform[&#39;test&#39;]) } loaders_scratch = { &#39;train&#39; : DataLoader(image_datasets[&#39;train&#39;], shuffle = True, batch_size = batch_size), &#39;valid&#39; : DataLoader(image_datasets[&#39;valid&#39;], shuffle = True, batch_size = batch_size), &#39;test&#39; : DataLoader(image_datasets[&#39;test&#39;], shuffle = True, batch_size = batch_size) } Question 3: Describe your chosen procedure for preprocessing the data. How does your code resize the images (by cropping, stretching, etc)? What size did you pick for the input tensor, and why? Did you decide to augment the dataset? If so, how (through translations, flips, rotations, etc)? If not, why not? Answer: The code resizes images by cropping, while on the trainning data it was done randomly using transforms.RandomResizedCrop, in the validation and testing dataset it was done with transforms.CenterCrop and also transforms.Resize. The input tensor receives inputs of size (3 x 224 x 224), and this size was chosen after constant trial and error. In addition, the following text was extrected from the Pytorch Documentation: All pre-trained models expect input images normalized in the same way, i.e. mini-batches of 3-channel RGB images of shape (3 x H x W), where H and W are expected to be at least 224. The images have to be loaded in to a range of [0, 1] and then normalized using mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]. Data augmentation was used to avoid overfitting, that means to avoid the a very good performance on the trainning set but a bed performane on the validation and testing datasets (bed generalization). The methods used were: Flipping the images horizontally Random Cropping: Extract randomly a 224 × 224 pixels section from 256 × 256 pixels RandomRotation: Randomly rotate the image by 10 degrees.

Answer: The CNN has five convolutional layers. The first layer has 16 filters, doubling every layer until 256 filters on the last layer. stride = 1 and padding = 1 in every layer. There are Relu activations after each layers. Each followed by a max pooling layer of size 2. There are two connected linear layers at the end are used, the first with 512 outputs, the second 113 (the number of classes). Dropout of 0.25 Batch normalization was applied after each max pooling.

(IMPLEMENTATION) Test the Model Try out your model on the test dataset of dog images. Use the code cell below to calculate and print the test loss and accuracy. Ensure that your test accuracy is greater than 10%. def test(loaders, model, criterion, use_cuda): # monitor test loss and accuracy test_loss = 0. correct = 0. total = 0. model.eval() for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(loaders[&#39;test&#39;]): # move to GPU if use_cuda: data, target = data.cuda(), target.cuda() # forward pass: compute predicted outputs by passing inputs to the model output = model(data) # calculate the loss loss = criterion(output, target) # update average test loss test_loss = test_loss + ((1 / (batch_idx + 1)) * (loss.data - test_loss)) # convert output probabilities to predicted class pred = output.data.max(1, keepdim=True)[1] # compare predictions to true label correct += np.sum(np.squeeze(pred.eq(target.data.view_as(pred))).cpu().numpy()) total += data.size(0) print(&#39;Test Loss: {:.6f}\n&#39;.format(test_loss)) print(&#39;\nTest Accuracy: %2d%% (%2d/%2d)&#39; % ( 100. * correct / total, correct, total)) # call test function test(loaders_scratch, model_scratch, criterion_scratch, use_cuda) Test Loss: 3.095411 Test Accuracy: 22% (190/836) Step 4: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning) You will now use transfer learning to create a CNN that can identify dog breed from images. Your CNN must attain at least 60% accuracy on the test set. (IMPLEMENTATION) Specify Data Loaders for the Dog Dataset Use the code cell below to write three separate data loaders for the training, validation, and test datasets of dog images (located at dogImages/train, dogImages/valid, and dogImages/test, respectively).

Describe why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem. Answer: In this project we will use the End of ConvNet approach for transfer learning. Since we have a small dataset to train our model, a model built from scratch would most likely perform poorly. The data used to train the VGG.16 is quite similar to our trainning data, added to the fact that our trainning data set is small makes it suited to this approach. The steps are the following: Add one fully connected layer replacing the last layer of the pre-trained model. This new fully connected layer will have 133 categories as output, differently from the previous deleted layer. Randomize the weights of the new fully connected layer Freeze all the weights from the pre-trained network Train the network to update the weights of the new fully connected layer After retrainning the model, the accuracy is ~ 85%, a satisfatory performance according to the asked threshold.

You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with ‘(IMPLEMENTATION)’ in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section, and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a ‘TODO’ statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully! Note: Once you have completed all of the code implementations, you need to finalize your work by exporting the Jupyter Notebook as an HTML document. Before exporting the notebook to html, all of the code cells need to have been run so that reviewers can see the final implementation and output. You can then export the notebook by using the menu above and navigating to File -&gt; Download as -&gt; HTML (.html). Include the finished document along with this notebook as your submission. In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a ‘Question X’ header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with ‘Answer:’. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide. Note: Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the Shift + Enter keyboard shortcut. Markdown cells can be edited by double-clicking the cell to enter edit mode. The rubric contains optional “Stand Out Suggestions” for enhancing the project beyond the minimum requirements. If you decide to pursue the “Stand Out Suggestions”, you should include the code in this Jupyter notebook. Why We’re Here In this notebook, you will make the first steps towards developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app. At the end of this project, your code will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog’s breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling. The image below displays potential sample output of your finished project (… but we expect that each student’s algorithm will behave differently!). In this real-world setting, you will need to piece together a series of models to perform different tasks; for instance, the algorithm that detects humans in an image will be different from the CNN that infers dog breed. There are many points of possible failure, and no perfect algorithm exists. Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience! The Road Ahead We break the notebook into separate steps. Feel free to use the links below to navigate the notebook. Step 0: Import Datasets Step 1: Detect Humans Step 2: Detect Dogs Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch) Step 4: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning) Step 5: Write your Algorithm Step 6: Test Your Algorithm Step 0: Import Datasets Make sure that you’ve downloaded the required human and dog datasets: Note: if you are using the Udacity workspace, you DO NOT need to re-download these - they can be found in the /data folder as noted in the cell below. Download the dog dataset. Unzip the folder and place it in this project’s home directory, at the location /dog_images. Download the human dataset. Unzip the folder and place it in the home directory, at location /lfw. Note: If you are using a Windows machine, you are encouraged to use 7zip to extract the folder. In the code cell below, we save the file paths for both the human (LFW) dataset and dog dataset in the numpy arrays human_files and dog_files. import numpy as np from glob import glob # load filenames for human and dog images human_files = np.array(glob(&quot;/data/lfw/*/*&quot;)) dog_files = np.array(glob(&quot;/data/dog_images/*/*/*&quot;)) # print number of images in each dataset print(&#39;There are %d total human images.&#39; % len(human_files)) print(&#39;There are %d total dog images.&#39; % len(dog_files)) There are 13233 total human images. There are 8351 total dog images. Step 1: Detect Humans In this section, we use OpenCV’s implementation of Haar feature-based cascade classifiers to detect human faces in images. OpenCV provides many pre-trained face detectors, stored as XML files on github. We have downloaded one of these detectors and stored it in the haarcascades directory. In the next code cell, we demonstrate how to use this detector to find human faces in a sample image. import cv2 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt %matplotlib inline # extract pre-trained face detector face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(&#39;haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml&#39;) # load color (BGR) image img = cv2.imread(human_files[0]) # convert BGR image to grayscale gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) # find faces in image faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray) # print number of faces detected in the image print(&#39;Number of faces detected:&#39;, len(faces)) # get bounding box for each detected face for (x,y,w,h) in faces: # add bounding box to color image cv2.rectangle(img,(x,y),(x+w,y+h),(255,0,0),2) # convert BGR image to RGB for plotting cv_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB) # display the image, along with bounding box plt.imshow(cv_rgb) plt.show() Number of faces detected: 1 Before using any of the face detectors, it is standard procedure to convert the images to grayscale. The detectMultiScale function executes the classifier stored in face_cascade and takes the grayscale image as a parameter. In the above code, faces is a numpy array of detected faces, where each row corresponds to a detected face. Each detected face is a 1D array with four entries that specifies the bounding box of the detected face. The first two entries in the array (extracted in the above code as x and y) specify the horizontal and vertical positions of the top left corner of the bounding box. The last two entries in the array (extracted here as w and h) specify the width and height of the box. Write a Human Face Detector We can use this procedure to write a function that returns True if a human face is detected in an image and False otherwise. This function, aptly named face_detector, takes a string-valued file path to an image as input and appears in the code block below. # returns &quot;True&quot; if face is detected in image stored at img_path def face_detector(img_path): img = cv2.imread(img_path) gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray) return len(faces) &gt; 0 (IMPLEMENTATION) Assess the Human Face Detector Question 1: Use the code cell below to test the performance of the face_detector function. What percentage of the first 100 images in human_files have a detected human face? What percentage of the first 100 images in dog_files have a detected human face? Ideally, we would like 100% of human images with a detected face and 0% of dog images with a detected face. You will see that our algorithm falls short of this goal, but still gives acceptable performance. We extract the file paths for the first 100 images from each of the datasets and store them in the numpy arrays human_files_short and dog_files_short.

Obtain Pre-trained VGG-16 Model The code cell below downloads the VGG-16 model, along with weights that have been trained on ImageNet, a very large, very popular dataset used for image classification and other vision tasks. ImageNet contains over 10 million URLs, each linking to an image containing an object from one of 1000 categories. import torch import torchvision.models as models # define VGG16 model VGG16 = models.vgg16(pretrained=True) # check if CUDA is available use_cuda = torch.cuda.is_available() # move model to GPU if CUDA is available if use_cuda: VGG16 = VGG16.cuda() Given an image, this pre-trained VGG-16 model returns a prediction (derived from the 1000 possible categories in ImageNet) for the object that is contained in the image. (IMPLEMENTATION) Making Predictions with a Pre-trained Model In the next code cell, you will write a function that accepts a path to an image (such as &#39;dogImages/train/001.Affenpinscher/Affenpinscher_00001.jpg&#39;) as input and returns the index corresponding to the ImageNet class that is predicted by the pre-trained VGG-16 model. The output should always be an integer between 0 and 999, inclusive. Before writing the function, make sure that you take the time to learn how to appropriately pre-process tensors for pre-trained models in the PyTorch documentation. from PIL import Image, ImageFile import torchvision.transforms as transforms from torchvision import datasets, models, transforms def VGG16_predict(img_path): &#39;&#39;&#39; Use pre-trained VGG-16 model to obtain index corresponding to predicted ImageNet class for image at specified path Args: img_path: path to an image Returns: Index corresponding to VGG-16 model&#39;s prediction &#39;&#39;&#39; ## TODO: Complete the function. ## Load and pre-process an image from the given img_path ## Return the *index* of the predicted class for that image ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True image = Image.open(img_path).convert(&#39;RGB&#39;) normalize = transforms.Normalize( mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225] ) preprocess = transforms.Compose([ transforms.Resize(256), transforms.CenterCrop(224), transforms.ToTensor(), normalize] ) img_tensor = preprocess(image) img_tensor.unsqueeze_(0) # Load the pretrained model from pytorch vgg16 = models.vgg16(pretrained=True) # get sample outputs output = vgg16(img_tensor) _, pred = torch.max(output, 1) return pred.numpy()[0] # predicted class index (IMPLEMENTATION) Write a Dog Detector While looking at the dictionary, you will notice that the categories corresponding to dogs appear in an uninterrupted sequence and correspond to dictionary keys 151-268, inclusive, to include all categories from &#39;Chihuahua&#39; to &#39;Mexican hairless&#39;. Thus, in order to check to see if an image is predicted to contain a dog by the pre-trained VGG-16 model, we need only check if the pre-trained model predicts an index between 151 and 268 (inclusive). Use these ideas to complete the dog_detector function below, which returns True if a dog is detected in an image (and False if not). ### returns &quot;True&quot; if a dog is detected in the image stored at img_path def dog_detector(img_path): ## TODO: Complete the function. output = VGG16_predict(img_path) return output &gt;= 151 and output &lt; 269 # true/false (IMPLEMENTATION) Assess the Dog Detector Question 2: Use the code cell below to test the performance of your dog_detector function. What percentage of the images in human_files_short have a detected dog? What percentage of the images in dog_files_short have a detected dog? Answer: ### TODO: Test the performance of the dog_detector function ### on the images in human_files_short and dog_files_short. countHuman = sum([dog_detector(human_files_short[i]) for i in n_range]) countDog = sum([dog_detector(dog_files_short[i]) for i in n_range]) print(&quot;Predicted Human Faces on Human dataset:&quot;, countHuman) print(&quot;Accuracy:&quot;, 1- countHuman/100, &quot;\\n&quot;) print(&quot;Predicted Human Faces on Dog dataset:&quot;, countDog) print(&quot;Accuracy:&quot;, countDog/100) Predicted Human Faces on Human dataset: 2 Accuracy: 0.98 Predicted Human Faces on Dog dataset: 100 Accuracy: 1.0 We suggest VGG-16 as a potential network to detect dog images in your algorithm, but you are free to explore other pre-trained networks (such as Inception-v3, ResNet-50, etc). Please use the code cell below to test other pre-trained PyTorch models.

In this step, you will create a CNN that classifies dog breeds. You must create your CNN from scratch (so, you can’t use transfer learning yet!), and you must attain a test accuracy of at least 10%. In Step 4 of this notebook, you will have the opportunity to use transfer learning to create a CNN that attains greatly improved accuracy. We mention that the task of assigning breed to dogs from images is considered exceptionally challenging. To see why, consider that even a human would have trouble distinguishing between a Brittany and a Welsh Springer Spaniel. Brittany Welsh Springer Spaniel It is not difficult to find other dog breed pairs with minimal inter-class variation (for instance, Curly-Coated Retrievers and American Water Spaniels). Curly-Coated Retriever American Water Spaniel Likewise, recall that labradors come in yellow, chocolate, and black. Your vision-based algorithm will have to conquer this high intra-class variation to determine how to classify all of these different shades as the same breed. Yellow Labrador Chocolate Labrador Black Labrador We also mention that random chance presents an exceptionally low bar: setting aside the fact that the classes are slightly imabalanced, a random guess will provide a correct answer roughly 1 in 133 times, which corresponds to an accuracy of less than 1%. Remember that the practice is far ahead of the theory in deep learning. Experiment with many different architectures, and trust your intuition. And, of course, have fun! (IMPLEMENTATION) Specify Data Loaders for the Dog Dataset Use the code cell below to write three separate data loaders for the training, validation, and test datasets of dog images (located at dog_images/train, dog_images/valid, and dog_images/test, respectively). You may find this documentation on custom datasets to be a useful resource. If you are interested in augmenting your training and/or validation data, check out the wide variety of transforms! from PIL import Image, ImageFile import os from torchvision import datasets from torchvision.datasets import ImageFolder from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader import torchvision.transforms as transforms import torch import PIL ### TODO: Write data loaders for training, validation, and test sets ## Specify appropriate transforms, and batch_sizes ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True # number of subprocesses and samples per batch num_workers = 0 batch_size = 20 # convert data to a normalized torch.FloatTensor transform = { &#39;train&#39;: transforms.Compose([ transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224), transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(), transforms.RandomRotation(10), transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]) ]), &#39;valid&#39;: transforms.Compose([ transforms.Resize(256), transforms.CenterCrop(224), transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]) ]), &#39;test&#39;: transforms.Compose([ transforms.Resize(256), transforms.CenterCrop(224), transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]) ]), } data_dir = &#39;/data/dog_images&#39; train_dir = data_dir + &#39;/train&#39; valid_dir = data_dir + &#39;/valid&#39; test_dir = data_dir + &#39;/test&#39; # Reading Dataset image_datasets = { &#39;train&#39; : ImageFolder(root=train_dir,transform=transform[&#39;train&#39;]), &#39;valid&#39; : ImageFolder(root=valid_dir,transform=transform[&#39;valid&#39;]), &#39;test&#39; : ImageFolder(root=test_dir,transform=transform[&#39;test&#39;]) } loaders_scratch = { &#39;train&#39; : DataLoader(image_datasets[&#39;train&#39;], shuffle = True, batch_size = batch_size), &#39;valid&#39; : DataLoader(image_datasets[&#39;valid&#39;], shuffle = True, batch_size = batch_size), &#39;test&#39; : DataLoader(image_datasets[&#39;test&#39;], shuffle = True, batch_size = batch_size) } Question 3: Describe your chosen procedure for preprocessing the data. How does your code resize the images (by cropping, stretching, etc)? What size did you pick for the input tensor, and why? Did you decide to augment the dataset? If so, how (through translations, flips, rotations, etc)? If not, why not? Answer: The code resizes images by cropping, while on the trainning data it was done randomly using transforms.RandomResizedCrop, in the validation and testing dataset it was done with transforms.CenterCrop and also transforms.Resize. The input tensor receives inputs of size (3 x 224 x 224), and this size was chosen after constant trial and error. In addition, the following text was extrected from the Pytorch Documentation: All pre-trained models expect input images normalized in the same way, i.e. mini-batches of 3-channel RGB images of shape (3 x H x W), where H and W are expected to be at least 224. The images have to be loaded in to a range of [0, 1] and then normalized using mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]. Data augmentation was used to avoid overfitting, that means to avoid the a very good performance on the trainning set but a bed performane on the validation and testing datasets (bed generalization). The methods used were: Flipping the images horizontally Random Cropping: Extract randomly a 224 × 224 pixels section from 256 × 256 pixels RandomRotation: Randomly rotate the image by 10 degrees.

Answer: The CNN has five convolutional layers. The first layer has 16 filters, doubling every layer until 256 filters on the last layer. stride = 1 and padding = 1 in every layer. There are Relu activations after each layers. Each followed by a max pooling layer of size 2. There are two connected linear layers at the end are used, the first with 512 outputs, the second 113 (the number of classes). Dropout of 0.25 Batch normalization was applied after each max pooling.

Describe why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem. Answer: In this project we will use the End of ConvNet approach for transfer learning. Since we have a small dataset to train our model, a model built from scratch would most likely perform poorly. The data used to train the VGG.16 is quite similar to our trainning data, added to the fact that our trainning data set is small makes it suited to this approach. The steps are the following: Add one fully connected layer replacing the last layer of the pre-trained model. This new fully connected layer will have 133 categories as output, differently from the previous deleted layer. Randomize the weights of the new fully connected layer Freeze all the weights from the pre-trained network Train the network to update the weights of the new fully connected layer After retrainning the model, the accuracy is ~ 85%, a satisfatory performance according to the asked threshold.

In this step, you will create a CNN that classifies dog breeds. You must create your CNN <em>from scratch</em> (so, you can’t use transfer learning <em>yet</em>!), and you must attain a test accuracy of at least 10%. In Step 4 of this notebook, you will have the opportunity to use transfer learning to create a CNN that attains greatly improved accuracy.</p> <p>We mention that the task of assigning breed to dogs from images is considered exceptionally challenging. To see why, consider that <em>even a human</em> would have trouble distinguishing between a Brittany and a Welsh Springer Spaniel.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Brittany</th> <th>Welsh Springer Spaniel</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><img src="images/Brittany_02625.jpg" width="100" /></td> <td><img src="images/Welsh_springer_spaniel_08203.jpg" width="200" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>It is not difficult to find other dog breed pairs with minimal inter-class variation (for instance, Curly-Coated Retrievers and American Water Spaniels).</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Curly-Coated Retriever</th> <th>American Water Spaniel</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><img src="images/Curly-coated_retriever_03896.jpg" width="200" /></td> <td><img src="images/American_water_spaniel_00648.jpg" width="200" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Likewise, recall that labradors come in yellow, chocolate, and black. Your vision-based algorithm will have to conquer this high intra-class variation to determine how to classify all of these different shades as the same breed.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Yellow Labrador</th> <th>Chocolate Labrador</th> <th>Black Labrador</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><img src="images/Labrador_retriever_06457.jpg" width="150" /></td> <td><img src="images/Labrador_retriever_06455.jpg" width="240" /></td> <td><img src="images/Labrador_retriever_06449.jpg" width="220" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>We also mention that random chance presents an exceptionally low bar: setting aside the fact that the classes are slightly imabalanced, a random guess will provide a correct answer roughly 1 in 133 times, which corresponds to an accuracy of less than 1%.</p> <p>Remember that the practice is far ahead of the theory in deep learning. Experiment with many different architectures, and trust your intuition.

Describe why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.</p> <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p> <p>In this project we will use the <strong>End of ConvNet approach</strong> for transfer learning. Since we have a small dataset to train our model, a model built from scratch would most likely perform poorly. The data used to train the VGG.16 is quite similar to our trainning data, added to the fact that our trainning data set is small makes it suited to this approach. The steps are the following:</p> <ol> <li>Add one fully connected layer replacing the last layer of the pre-trained model. This new fully connected layer will have 133 categories as output, differently from the previous deleted layer.</li> <li>Randomize the weights of the new fully connected layer</li> <li>Freeze all the weights from the pre-trained network</li> <li>Train the network to update the weights of the new fully connected layer</li> </ol> <p>After retrainning the model, the accuracy is ~ 85%, a satisfatory performance according to the asked threshold.</p> <h3 id="implementation-specify-loss-function-and-optimizer-1">(IMPLEMENTATION) Specify Loss Function and Optimizer</h3> <p>Use the next code cell to specify a <a href="http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#loss-functions">loss function</a> and <a href="http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html">optimizer</a>.

What kind of dog does the algorithm think that <em>you</em> look like? If you have a dog, does it predict your dog’s breed accurately? If you have a cat, does it mistakenly think that your cat is a dog?</p> <h3 id="implementation-test-your-algorithm-on-sample-images">(IMPLEMENTATION) Test Your Algorithm on Sample Images!</h3> <p>Test your algorithm at least six images on your computer. Feel free to use any images you like. Use at least two human and two dog images.</p> <p><strong>Question 6:</strong> Is the output better than you expected :) ? Or worse :( ? Provide at least three possible points of improvement for your algorithm.</p> <p><strong>Answer:</strong> (Three possible points for improvement)</p> <ol> <li>Find different models to applly transfer learning (such as resnet…) and achieve better accuracy.</li> <li>Work with a bigger dataset to train the model.</li> <li>Improve pre-processing steps, with more data augmentation.</li> </ol><div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">## TODO: Execute your algorithm from Step 6 on
