The first time I heard the term data science was in a conversation with a fellow intern at a Private Equity firm. He had just decided to leave the company and came to say goodbye. I asked him why he was leaving, and we started a long conversation. It was in December 2015. He told me he was starting a Master of Mathematical Modelling in the following week.  I was quite curious about it and made a couple of questions.  What is this course about? What is the difference to a normal Math Masters? What will you be learning in this course? 
I understood from his explanation that the course was much more applied than a regular program; they worked intensively with data, and computational skills were required throughout the course. I believe it was the first I heard someone saying the terms “Big Data” and “Data Science”. I was impressed and extremely interested in everything he said and started to research it.  It was like a door opening to a new world. 
On the following weeks, I started to read every day about Data Science. I got to know other terms such as Machine Learning, Python, R, Neural Networks and so on. I found a lot of content online such courses, blogs and videos (today there is a whole lot more). I was fascinated by the world of possibilities in this new field and wanted to know more about how I could get involved. I wanted to educate myself about the topic but didn’t know how or where to start. Should I do a Masters?  Or maybe start studying online? Who could help me? These were a few questions is my mind at that moment.
