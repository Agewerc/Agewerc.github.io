The first time I heard the term data science was in a conversation with a fellow intern at a Private Equity firm. 
He had just decided to leave the company and came to say goodbye. I asked him why he was leaving, and we started a long conversation. 
It was in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in December 2015. He told me he was starting a Master of Mathematical Modelling in the following week. 
The course was in one of the best universities in the country. I was quite curious about it and made a couple of questions.  
What is this course about? What is the difference to a normal Math Masters? What will you be learning in this course? <br>
I understood from his explanation that the course was much more applied than a regular program; they worked intensively with data, 
and computational skills were required throughout the course. I believe it was the first I heard someone saying the terms “Big Data” and “Data Science”. 
I was impressed and extremely interested in everything he said and started to research it.  It was like a door opening to a new world. <br>
On the following weeks, I started to read every day about Data Science. I got to know other terms such as Machine Learning, Python, R, Neural Networks and so on. 
I found a lot of content online such courses, blogs and videos (today there is a whole lot more). 
I was fascinated by the world of possibilities in this new field and wanted to know more about how I could get involved. 
I wanted to educate myself about the topic but didn’t know how or where to start. Should I do a Masters?  Or maybe start studying online? Who could help me? 
These were a few questions in my mind at that moment. <br>
I decided to talk to the director of the program my friend had just started to see if I also had a fit. 
I have always considered myself more of a hands-on, learn-by-doing practical person. 
Before getting to know this new field, I had never considered doing a masters. 
So I went more to listen about the course and its perspectives more than to talk about myself. And the conversation was much better than I expected.<br> 
The program was not about “Data Science” but the specialization in “Information Modelling” was one of the three pathways available. 
Some of the units available in the program were “Machine Learning”, “Data Minning” and “Network Science”. 
Researches from the department of the university were modelling outcomes of soccer games, the spread of epidemics and the behaviour of the stock market. 
I was presented to many of the professors of the University staff. 
They were friendly and explained to me with surprising confidence how their field (of modelling) was going to transform society over the next years. 
They were undoubtedly right.  If you are interested, this is the [program] (https://emap.fgv.br/mestrado/modelagem-matematica) (in Portuguese). <br>
I felt doing the master could be an excellent opportunity for self-development and to dive deep in this exciting new world. 
However, at that moment, I had not even finished my degree in economics. 
I was actually in my last semester and working on the graduation project. 
I had a few years of experience working with finance as an intern in financial markets. 
And to make things more complicated, I had just received an offer to work in one of the largest retail companies in Brazil, a great opportunity. 
To avoid making decisions in a rush that I could regret on the future, I decided to take it slow. 
I accepted the job offer, but I knew that my data science journey had just begun.
