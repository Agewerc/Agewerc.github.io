## Getting in Touch With Data Science
<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
The first time I heard the term data science was in a conversation with a fellow intern at a Private Equity firm. 
He had just decided to leave the company and came to say goodbye. I asked him why he was leaving, and we started a long conversation. 
It was in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in December 2015. He told me he was starting a Master of Mathematical Modelling in the following week. 
The course was in one of the best universities in the country. I was quite curious about it and made a couple of questions.  
What is this course about? What is the difference to a normal Math Masters? What will you be learning in this course? <br>
I understood from his explanation that the course was much more applied than a regular program; they worked intensively with data, 
and computational skills were required throughout the course. I believe it was the first I heard someone saying the terms “Big Data” and “Data Science”. 
I was impressed and extremely interested in everything he said and started to research it.  It was like a door opening to a new world. <br>
On the following weeks, I started to read every day about Data Science. I got to know other terms such as Machine Learning, Python, R, Neural Networks and so on. 
I found a lot of content online such courses, blogs and videos (today there is a whole lot more). 
I was fascinated by the world of possibilities in this new field and wanted to know more about how I could get involved. 
I wanted to educate myself about the topic but didn’t know how or where to start. Should I do a Masters?  Or maybe start studying online? Who could help me? 
These were a few questions in my mind at that moment. <br>
I decided to talk to the director of the program my friend had just started to see if I also had a fit. 
I have always considered myself more of a hands-on, learn-by-doing practical person. 
Before getting to know this new field, I had never considered doing a masters. 
So I went more to listen about the course and its perspectives more than to talk about myself. And the conversation was much better than I expected.<br>
The program was not about “Data Science” but the specialization in “Information Modelling” was one of the three pathways available. 
Some of the units available in the program were “Machine Learning”, “Data Minning” and “Network Science”. 
Researches from the department of the university were modelling outcomes of soccer games, the spread of epidemics and the behaviour of the stock market. 
I was presented to many of the professors of the University staff. 
They were friendly and explained to me with surprising confidence how their field (of modelling) was going to transform society over the next years. 
They were undoubtedly right. If you are interested, this is the <a href="https://emap.fgv.br/mestrado/modelagem-matematica">link</a> (in Portuguese). <br>
I felt doing the master could be an excellent opportunity for self-development and to dive deep in this exciting new world. 
However, at that moment, I had not even finished my degree in economics. 
I was actually in my last semester and working on the graduation project. 
I had a few years of experience working with finance as an intern in financial markets. 
And to make things more complicated, I had just received an offer to work in one of the largest retail companies in Brazil, a great opportunity. 
To avoid making decisions in a rush that I could regret on the future, I decided to take it slow. 
I accepted the job offer, but I knew that my data science journey had just begun.

## Learning Independently
<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
I decided to do my best to learn Data Science by myself. My first action was to get an account on Data Camp, which is a fantastic website. 
The same University in which I decided not to do the master was also offering a one-year extension Data Science course. I also enrolled. <br>
In my new job, I was initially working primarily with finance and using spreadsheets. However, I was eager to use and implement some of this new knowledge In development. 
It was a fertile terrain. In the area, we were working with massive datasets, that had all financial transactions and accounting data of the company—billions of data points monthly.
The routines on the area were done manually in Excel and took many hours to finalized every day. <br>
However, it felt there was resistance to change. For most big corporations that do not come from the tech sector, the adaptation for this new era is slow. 
They have most of their workers skilled in some tools which are not the latest technologies, and most people are reluctant to change. Sometimes even the leadership of the company. 
Even though I had a supportive manager who was interested, the process to accelerate change was slow. <br>
I did have the chance to develop new things for the area such as new dashboards and reports, but I just felt a lot more was possible. 
A new team on the company was under development at the time, a group of business analytics, so I applied to relocate. <br>
Meanwhile, I kept studying every day online. But I wanted to learn more, and learn faster. Many of the courses online give you an impression 
that in one month you will become a specialist of some topic. That is just not possible. I felt I needed to dedicate myself for a long time to this course.<br>
So before I even had the chance of being relocated to inside the company, I made a decision. Quit and do a master.

## Finding the perfect course
<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
There are many good masters of Data Science worldwide, but way less than other well-established topics such as Computer Science, 
Law or Economics. For instance, in my home country, Brazil, there was none. Not exclusively focused on Data Science. 
The more advanced countries in the education of Data Science (in 2018) are the U.S, U.K and Australia. 
Some of the topics I was concerned when applying were the following:
-	What to do if you do not have IT background?
-	How long will the course take?
-	What technologies will I learn?
-	What is the reputation of the University?
I found a total of 31 masters worldwide in which I felt I had a good fit. I spent one month entirely focused on making my applications: cover letters, recommendations from previous lectures and much more. I was fortunate enough to be approved in most applications. My choice was the Master of Data Science from Monash University in Australia.
